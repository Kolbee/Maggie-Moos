            <p> Q: How do you determine what you bring to an event?</p>

            <br>


            A: We load the truck up with our most popular flavors and toppings requested most by the people we serve. If you have flavors or toppings you want to make sure we bring, just let us know! All of our services include the option of a cup or
            cone, and we bring spoons and napkins for all guests.
            <br>
            Q: Do you staff the station?
            <br>
            A: Yes, our trained staff will be there to create the treats for your guests. If you prefer a self-serve experience, we can accommodate that request.
            <br>
            Q: How far in advance do you book?
            <br>
            A: We book our portable ice cream mix-in station and MaggieMoo's Truck as much as two years in advance. For all other catering we prefer to have a week’s notice so that we can properly prepare and secure necessary products and staffing.
            But if you need a last minute catering gig, we do everything we can to accommodate!
            <br>
            Q: How far will you travel for an event?
            <br>
            Q: How do you charge?
            <br>
            A: Our charges are based on a per person price. Our prices range from $3-$6/person depending on the size and type of event.
            <br>
            Q: Do you require a deposit?
            <br>
            A: Yes, we require a 25% down payment on the event to officially hold the date. The remaining balance is due at the conclusion of the event. A lot of clients prefer to pay in advance so that they do not have to worry about payment on the
            date of the event.
            <br>
            Q: Do you charge for Travel or Delivery?
            <br>
            A: There is no travel or delivery charge for events within 25 miles of our store locations. For events outside 25 miles, we charge the standard IRS mileage rate at the time for every mile over the 25 mile radius.
            <br>
            Q:Do you offer “large group discounts?”
            <br>
            A: Yes, for large groups we will offer a discount on our price. Please inquire about a discount if you have a large group.
            <br>
            Q: How long will you serve?
            <br>
            A: We typically serve from 1-3 hours depending on the size of the event and the services selected. We are happy to stay longer if necessary.
            <br>
            Q: What do you need from the client?
            <br>
            A: The only thing we need from a client is typically an electrical outlet and lots of ice cream eaters… :). On occasion we will request that the client provide a table, especially on long commutes.
            <br>
            Q: Can you combine your Catering Options?
            <br>
            A: Sure…for example, if you want to have our Ice Cream Mix-in Station, Waffle Baker and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries, we will package those and offer a discount. If you are interested in multiple things, please let us know and we are
            happy to offer you a custom quote.
            <br>
            Q: My venue will not allow outside vendors. What do I do?
            <br>
            A: Fortunately, most venues view us similarly to the “cake.” Because we have such a specialized service that they can’t offer, we are rarely turned down by a venue to serve. We have served at various hotels and clubs on numerous
            occasions. We are happy to speak with the venue on your behalf if you would like.
            <br>
            Q: Do you have any low fat options?
            <br>
            A: Yes—we have our new line of Low Fat Scoopable Yogurt that can be made into virtually any flavor. We also carry Sorbet, which is non-dairy and non-fat. Both products are made fresh in our store, just like the ice cream. We always try to
            include one of each in our Truck caterings if possible.
