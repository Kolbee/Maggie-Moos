Maggie Moo's has been in business since they opened their first store in Kansas City in 1989. Over the last 30 years they have grown to 19 different store locations across the united states.
This website was made by Kolbee Hulsey and Grace Dyer. We are both students at Madison Academic Magnet High School.
