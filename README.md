 Maggie Moo's Website

Maggie Moo's has been in business since they opened their first store in Kansas City in 1989. Over the last 30 years they have grown to 19 different store locations across the united states. Jackson's Maggie Moo's already had a website, but they allowed us to create one for them. There weren't many strict guidelines given in regard to how they wanted the website to look. Because of this, we were able to add in our own creative and original style to the website.

This website was made by Kolbee Hulsey and Grace Dyer. We are both students at Madison Academic Magnet High School.

Throughout this process, we bounced ideas off of one another for almost every issue. We designed this website's look aimed towards young kids, but we designed the actual use of the website to be easy for parents. Our color scheme follows the well known Maggie Moo's color and logo. We have included all of the different kinds of treats that Maggie Moo's offers, along with special opportunities such as booking Maggie's Truck. We even have a form to fill out to book the truck for any event. We made sure to add all the contact information that would be needed to find Maggie Moo's as well as delivery options. Because Maggie Moo's has recently joined with Great American Cookies, we made sure to add the cookies into this website.

Thank you for taking the time to look at our website!
